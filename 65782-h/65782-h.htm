<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">1</span></h2>
<p>Hannah was fat and her knees were getting
stiff. When she had a chance to rest on the
well-polished stool before the fireplace, it was
a groaning misery for her to get up again. Her
head, wrapped in a starched white turban,
thrust forward followed by a lunge of her shoulders
till finally her legs could be persuaded to
lift her erect. But once on foot she glared at the
black women who giggled in corners, and at
toothless old Moll. Moll had come all the way
from Virginia. She remembered the long terrifying
journey down the river to the Cumberland,
the Indians, the hardships. She was privileged.
She had no work to do now.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You black trash better stir your stumps,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
Hannah snapped, &ldquo;Heap of company comin&rsquo;.
You, Betty, you put more sage in that dressin&rsquo;.
I raised them turkeys. Ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to have &rsquo;em
ruint. Mis&rsquo; Jackson, she like her turkey seasoned
high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Betty, narrow-faced and thin-lipped, gave an
irritated shrug. But she did not look about for
sympathetic support from the others, from the
heckling tyranny of old Hannah, knowing that
it would be nonexistent. Betty was a pariah on
the plantation, holding her place only because
she was the best cook in the county. Last year
she had been sent back from Pensacola for
rebellious behavior. It was whispered that she
had been ordered whipped by General Jackson,
had escaped that bitter disgrace because the
General&rsquo;s lady had a heart as soft as butter. No
other house servant at the Hermitage had ever
been ordered whipped and the stigma of her
disgrace lay now over Betty&rsquo;s peaked brows, her
bitter mouth. Nobody ever talked to her, they
all shied away from her aura of wickedness. All
but Emily Donelson, Rachel Jackson&rsquo;s favorite
niece.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>&ldquo;You let Betty alone,&rdquo; Emily ordered now,
looking up from counting out silver on a long
table. &ldquo;Dilsey, you see that Simmy rubs all
these spoons with fuller&rsquo;s earth and soda. Let&rsquo;s
see&mdash;I count fifty-two. There&rsquo;ll be Hutchingses
and Hayses, Eastins, Donelsons&mdash;we&rsquo;ll have to
set two tables and the children may have to
wait. Has Sary got the napkins ironed good and
stiff?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sary ironin&rsquo; in the washhouse now, Young
Miss. She just yelled for Goby fetch her more
charcoal to hot her irons up good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hannah, you come along with me while I
ask aunt Rachel to unlock the press. We&rsquo;ll need
all the long tablecloths and they&rsquo;ll have to be
pressed. I&rsquo;ll need four more spoons. These are
those lovely French ones uncle Jackson brought
from New Orleans. You tell Simmy to be
mighty careful with them, Dilsey. Come along,
Hannah. People may begin coming in today.
There&rsquo;s a lot to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young Master Jack, he comin&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Hannah
boldly, grinning at the bright flush that
warmed the young girl&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>Emily, fifteen, imperiously lovely, red-haired,
shook her head sadly. &ldquo;Uncle Jackson won&rsquo;t let
him come. I think it&rsquo;s mean. He&rsquo;s making Jack
stay on in that old law school when he wants
to be at home for Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learnin&rsquo;,&rdquo; commented Hannah. &ldquo;It mighty
fine. Do Mis&rsquo; Rachel read to me outen her
Bible, glory just shine around. And when the
General spout big words out of books I gits
shivers up my back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emily hurried along the bricked way that set
the kitchen apart from the big house. The wind
was fresh and keen off the Tennessee hills and
she drew her shawl close around her slender
shoulders. In the house huge wood fires burned
in three fireplaces but the hall where the curving
stairs came down was chilly. She opened
the dining room door and slipped inside
quickly.</p>
<p>Rachel Jackson, with a Negro woman helping
and a half-grown boy up on a stool, was
getting china down from a high corner cupboard.</p>
<p>Aunt Rachel was getting heavy, Emily noted,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
and her breath quick and short. She gasped
occasionally as she bent over the table, counting
the plates the Negress set down, laughing a
little as she straightened and drew a long
breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, I must be getting old, Emily. I get so
short-winded every time I exert myself the least
bit. I declare these china plates are still the
prettiest ones I&rsquo;ve got. Not a nick in one of
them. That&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve always washed them
myself. These came all the way from Pittsburgh
by boat. My gracious, that was twenty-seven
years ago! Brother Samuel went all the way up
into Kentucky some place with the wagon to
meet the boat and bring the goods to Nashville
to your uncle Jackson&rsquo;s store. Indians were
everywhere too, those days. I was so nervous I
couldn&rsquo;t sleep till Brother Sam got back and my
husband too&mdash;he was away off to Philadelphia.
Sam was gone forty six days and my husband
gone for two months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been alone so much, aunt Rachel. If
ever I get a husband I won&rsquo;t let him leave me
for even one day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>Rachel let her breath out slowly. There was
that little pain again, that came sometimes. She
used Magic Sanitive Salve faithfully as her husband
directed but it didn&rsquo;t seem to do much
good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you get a husband he&rsquo;ll go where duty
calls him and you won&rsquo;t be able to hold him
back any more than any other woman. But it
does look as though duty called Andrew Jackson
more than most men and into more dangerous
places. I declare I still like these old plates
best of all. Maybe it&rsquo;s because they were the
first nice things ever I owned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Jackson likes the dangerous places,&rdquo;
Emily said. &ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t have missed all that
Indian fighting and defeating the British at
New Orleans for anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel pursed her lips. &ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t like that
business of being governor of Florida any better
than I did. Thank the Lord we got away
from that place! So hot there in Pensacola and
all that babble-gabble around you, all Spanish
so you couldn&rsquo;t tell if they were calling you
names or not. I was mighty thankful to turn my
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
face back towards Tennessee and poor little
Andy was sick every minute we were there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the mosquitoes,&rdquo; declared Andrew
Jackson, Junior, from his high perch on the stool.
&ldquo;They poisoned me. I can&rsquo;t help it if my hide
is thin. And all that pepper in the victuals&mdash;onions
too, and I never could bear onions.
What else do you want from up here, Mama?
Nothing left but soup tureens and teapots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need two tureens. Your Papa thinks he
hasn&rsquo;t had anything to eat unless he has soup.
Count those plates again, will you, Emily? My
head&rsquo;s all in a swivet. As many crowds of people
as I&rsquo;ve fed on this place you&rsquo;d think I&rsquo;d get
used to it but I always forget something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah came in then for the tablecloths that
Sary would press. Little Negroes would hold
the corners and edges high so that they would
not touch the floor and when the five-yard
lengths of damask were glistening smooth they
would be carried in ceremoniously and spread
over a spare bed till Christmas morning.</p>
<p>Rachel Jackson liked to be proud of her table,
and this was Christmas, the first Christmas that
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
she had had her husband at home with her for
more years than she liked to remember. She
walked through the rooms of her beautiful, new
brick house trying not to feel too sinfully proud.
Her new, lovely Hermitage, built under the
huge trees exactly where she had wished it to
be looked out upon the fields of the plantation
through windows that in the parlors were curtained
with lace.</p>
<p>Upstairs and in her own big bedroom below
were the fine French beds the General had
bought in New Orleans. Seven crates of beautiful
furniture on which the freight bill alone had
been two hundred and seventy-three dollars.
Her own bed was elegantly fluted, of mahogany,
with high posts, a mosquito canopy of the
finest muslin and a knotted Marseilles counterpane.</p>
<p>There was the new sideboard in the dining
room too, and in the cellar gallons of the best
brandy, old Madeira, claret and porter, bottles
of bitters in green glass and boxes of candied
fruit. The turkeys and chickens old Hannah
had raised so faithfully were fat, and five turkeys
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
were being readied for roasting now in the
kitchen. Rachel paused at a south window and
looked out across the wide lawn, a bit bleak
now that the trees were bare and all the flowers
of her garden brown and dead from frost. The
pillared portico made her heart expand with
pride.</p>
<p>A far cry, this palace of a house from the old
log blockhouse in which they had lived for so
many years, where she had lain alone for so
many desolate nights, thinking of that audacious
firebrand of a man she had married, that
Andrew Jackson who had spent so much of a
long life fighting enemies, red and white. Fighting
the Creek and the Cherokee, fighting the
British. Fighting Jesse Benton and young
Charles Dickinson, who had died after that
grim, dreadful duel in Kentucky.</p>
<p>Rachel shut her lips tight, remembering. All
for her, that hot-headed encounter. All for her
the bullet Andrew Jackson still carried so dangerously
near to his heart that it could not be
removed. Jesse Benton&rsquo;s bullet had shattered
the General&rsquo;s arm too, so that he had carried
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
the arm in a sling through all the Indian war
in Alabama. The arm still ached at night when
a cold wind blew.</p>
<p>A fighting man whose eyes too quickly kindled
to blue lightnings, whose reddish hair
seemed to burn with some flame within him
that was never cooled. Her own gentle counsel
could damper it down now and then, but only
briefly. Given the provocation, his temper
leaped alive like a drawn sword and he became
then, his wife was thinking sadly, as dangerous
and unpredictable as one of those wild
stallions that snorted and charged about the
Hermitage meadows.</p>
<p>The amazing contradiction about him was
that in his letters, in their quiet conversations
in the big bright bedroom, he voiced only one
passionate desire: to be able to live on here
quietly for the rest of his days in this home he
had built. He yearned, so he had written her
so many times, to be free of wars and politics,
answerable to no one but the call of his heart.
Not to Madison nor Monroe nor any other president.
Not to Sam Houston nor Governor Billy
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
Carroll of Tennessee, nor even to Major John
Eaton who seemed, in Rachel&rsquo;s mind, to be forever
grooming Andrew Jackson for some job or
other, always important, always controversial
and inevitably always far from the Hermitage.</p>
<p>She saw them now, riding up the drive from
the muddy road, the General and John Eaton.
Her husband sat very tall and a little gaunt on
the saddle and his gray horse seemed always
to sense the mood of his master and hold his
head very high. Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s hair, graying
a little now, blew wildly over his ears under his
beaver hat. His high collar and stock hid the
thinness of his throat.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p>
<p>He had been such a skinny lad, Rachel Jackson
remembered, when John Overton had
brought him, a stripling lawyer, to her mother&rsquo;s
house on the Cumberland, in that spring
of 1789. And now it was 1823! Where had the
years gone? The Widow Donelson had taken
him in, and there in the house had been Rachel,
Rachel Robards then, reconciled briefly to her
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
violent, unpredictable husband, Lewis Robards,
after a separation that had seen Rachel vilified,
discarded, and abused.</p>
<p>The widow had tried hard to put some meat
on that lanky young lawyer&rsquo;s frame, but now,
thirty-four years and four wars later, he was
still too thin, still coughed too much and was
weakened by digestive distresses from living
too long on parched corn and other scanty fare.</p>
<p>Philip, the horse handler, came running out
to take the bridles of the mounts and even
through the windowpanes Rachel could hear
her husband giving Philip orders in his high,
arresting voice, the same voice that had commanded
the defeat of General Pakenham at
New Orleans, shouted defiance at Red Feather
at Tohopeka and the Spanish governor at Pensacola.</p>
<p>Now he came shouting into the house. &ldquo;Mrs.
Jackson! Mrs. Jackson! Where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never had they called each other by their
Christian names. In letters they wrote, &ldquo;My
dearest.&rdquo; At home he was the General, to her, or
simply Husband. She was Mrs. Jackson, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
woman he honored, adored, had fought for and
would defend fiercely till her last breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Husband!&rdquo; She hurried out into the
hall where the two men were handing their
damp cloaks to a servant. &ldquo;Mr. Eaton, you are
welcome as always here. Come in to the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feels like snow.&rdquo; John Eaton slapped his
gloves against his knee, shook moisture from
his high-crowned hat. &ldquo;Misting now, but it&rsquo;s
getting colder. Miss Emily,&rdquo;&mdash;he made a courtly
bow as they entered the warm parlor&mdash;&ldquo;you
grow more beautiful every day. How any young
man can stay away from you is a puzzle in my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emily made her curtsy. &ldquo;You flatter me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All our girls are pretty,&rdquo; stated the General,
moving a chair near to the fire for his wife.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the air here on this hill. We keep &rsquo;em here
as long as we can, then sometimes we have to
let &rsquo;em go home to their mothers, but not for
long. Be seated, Mrs. Jackson. You look weary,
my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is tired,&rdquo; Emily said. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been putting
out dishes and silver all day, attending to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
Christmas dinner. Uncle Jackson,&rdquo; she began
timidly, &ldquo;if Jack should ride home for Christmas&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; declared the General testily, getting
down his long clay pipe from the mantelpiece.
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t because I wrote and gave him
his orders not to come. I told him that the important
thing for him now is to finish his schooling
and get admitted to the bar. I&rsquo;ve raised that
boy.&rdquo; He filled the pipe and handed it to Eaton.
&ldquo;You smoke that, John. I like my old corncob
best. I raised that boy, Andrew Jackson Donelson.
Going to make a gentleman and a scholar
out of him. He&rsquo;ll have the chance I never had,
he and young Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Donelson is your nephew, Mrs. Jackson?&rdquo;
Eaton drew on the pipe to which Emily
held a spill she had lighted at the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My brother&rsquo;s son. But we&rsquo;ve had him here
with us since he was four years old. Andy, our
adopted son, is my brother Severn&rsquo;s boy. We
took him four days after he was born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twins,&rdquo; remarked the General. &ldquo;Severn&rsquo;s
wife was mighty frail and one baby was all she
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
could nurse. So we took Andy off her hands.
All named after me,&rdquo; he grinned, &ldquo;a whole
covey of &rsquo;em, Donelsons, Hutchingses and
Hayeses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must see about supper, Mr. Jackson. You
gentlemen will excuse me?&rdquo; Rachel got up too
quickly and the little pain caught at her and
she put a quick hand to her breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go, aunt Rachel, you sit still and rest,&rdquo;
Emily volunteered quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want her to sit here and listen to my news,&rdquo;
said the General, thumbing down his pipe.
&ldquo;You too, Emily. Let the women attend to the
supper. About a dozen of &rsquo;em around, ought
to be able to manage to feed us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel had turned pale. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;Not Pensacola again! Not another war. I can&rsquo;t
bear it. You said we&rsquo;d stay at home. Mr. Jackson,
you swore we&rsquo;d live here in peace in our new
Hermitage.&rdquo; Distress sharpened her voice, her
eyes dimmed, and she dabbed at them nervously
with a corner of her white shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Compose yourself, my dear,&rdquo; comforted her
husband. &ldquo;This news I&rsquo;ve brought is exciting.
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
You&rsquo;ll be pleased. You&rsquo;re being offered an opportunity
to go where few women have ever
gone&mdash;American women, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to go anywhere,&rdquo; Rachel
almost wailed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been to Kentucky and Florida
and Washington and Natchez and New
Orleans and I hated all those places. I just want
to stay in my home and I want you to stay in
it with me. Mr. Eaton, we&rsquo;ve been separated
more than we have been together all these
years we&rsquo;ve been married, Mr. Jackson and I,
and now were both getting old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Old? You call yourself old, dear lady?&rdquo; protested
Eaton. &ldquo;Why, the best part of your life
is ahead of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; she sighed, pressing her hands
together, strong, sun-browned hands that had
helped to steer a heavy boat down the Ohio
River, that had gripped the rein on many a
weary ride through the wilderness, poured lead
into bullet molds when savage enemies howled
outside the stockades, spun thread, planted
rosebushes, tenderly comforted many a child.
&ldquo;It could be,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;if only I could
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
have those years in my home with my husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General&rsquo;s eyes twinkled. He rapped out
his pipe on an andiron, brushed tobacco from
his tight, snuff-colored trousers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m disappointed in you, my dear,&rdquo; he bantered.
&ldquo;Here I bring you news that you could
have a chance to cross an ocean and see a new,
strange, fascinating world, and you don&rsquo;t even
want to hear about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ocean?&rdquo; gasped Emily. &ldquo;Oh, no, uncle
Jackson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s face had drained gray. She pressed
both hands hard on her chest where the pain
sprang alive, shutting off her breath, making
her ears throb. Eaton half rose from his chair,
looking at her uneasily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop teasing her, General,&rdquo; he warned.
&ldquo;Tell her about President Monroe&rsquo;s magnificent
offer&mdash;which you don&rsquo;t mean to accept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson took a pose on the hearth,
a boyish grin lightening his long face. Emily
drew a breath of relief, laid her hand against
Rachel&rsquo;s cold cheek.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right. Uncle Jackson is just having
one of his jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel relaxed a little. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like jokes,&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;Not when they scare me half to
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this is a splendid joke, my dear,&rdquo; insisted
her husband. &ldquo;John and I laughed about it all
the way home&mdash;especially we laughed at what
Secretary Adams said about it. President Monroe
has offered to send me as ambassador to
Russia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Russia!&rdquo; both women cried at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you aren&rsquo;t going, uncle Jackson?&rdquo; Emily
asked when the silence had stretched too long.
&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s thousands and thousands of miles
away! They have wolves there and snow all the
year&mdash;I read it in a book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel had never had time to read many
books. There had always been too much to do.
Russia was as vague, as far, and as uncivilized
as China or Africa in her gentle mind. She sat
rigidly waiting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not going to Russia,&rdquo; announced the
General finally.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;What was it Secretary Adams said?&rdquo; Emily
asked.</p>
<p>Jackson&rsquo;s laughter pealed. &ldquo;When the idea
was talked about in Washington and Monroe
proposed to the cabinet to send me over there&mdash;to
get me out of the country, my love. That&rsquo;s
his motive and I&rsquo;m not at all deceived by the
flattering language of the letter of invitation. I
know what James Monroe had in mind. Your
husband is a disturbing influence in these
United States. Mrs. Jackson,&rdquo;&mdash;he leaned over
and gave her a tweak on her soft arm&mdash;&ldquo;your
husband stirs up fights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marches an army in Florida and sets the
governor back on his haunches,&rdquo; put in Eaton.
&ldquo;Beats a British army with a little handful of
farmers and hunters. And pirates! A dangerous
man, Mrs. Jackson. He licked the Creeks and
the Cherokee and made this southwest safe to
live in. And there are some people who are
talking around among themselves that Andrew
Jackson ought to be President of the United
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he can&rsquo;t be!&rdquo; said Rachel firmly. &ldquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
won&rsquo;t hear of it. He&rsquo;s not strong nor well, you
know that, John Eaton. He can&rsquo;t even eat plain
victuals half the time, and he coughs at night
no matter how much salve I rub on his chest.
Besides,&rdquo;&mdash;she got to her feet, smoothing out
her black silk skirt&mdash;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to live in any
palace&mdash;anywhere! Not in Russia. Not in Washington.
I&rsquo;d rather be a doorkeeper in the house
of the Lord than to live in the finest palace ever
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t told us what Secretary Adams
said,&rdquo; persisted Emily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was really a compliment,&rdquo; Eaton told
them, &ldquo;though I doubt if Adams intended it that
way. He listened to the president&rsquo;s proposal and
snorted. He snorts very eloquently, the little
man. &lsquo;Send Andrew Jackson to represent this
country in the court of the Czar,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;and that would be the end of peace with
Russia!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl&rsquo;s laughter rippled. She flew across
the room and kissed the General&rsquo;s chin. &ldquo;You
quarrelsome old thing! What a pity they don&rsquo;t
know you as we know you, that soft heart you
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
carry around under all those medals&mdash;and bristles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her, then pushed her away, his
mouth set firmly. &ldquo;Flattery will get you nothing,
young woman! I am not going to let Jack Donelson
come home for Christmas. A long trip for
a few days&rsquo; visit. He spends too much now, the
young rascal. All these youngsters,&rdquo; he told
Eaton, &ldquo;think the old man is made of money.
Thirteen-cent cotton and shippers take more
than half of that. Sell a fine colt and you get
less than the worth of the hay to raise him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have bought all that expensive
furniture, Mr. Jackson,&rdquo; worried Rachel.
&ldquo;We could have got along with what we
had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We lived in a log blockhouse then. Haven&rsquo;t
you earned a decent bed to sleep in, my dear,
after thirty-two years of putting up with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the children need the money&mdash;&rdquo; Rachel
always spoke of her numerous nieces and nephews
who considered the Hermitage their part-time
home as &ldquo;the children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just think they need it. Including you,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
my spoiled pet.&rdquo; He gave Emily a pinch, ignoring
her downcast face. &ldquo;All spoiled, the whole
pack of you. Young Andy worst of all. Where is
that scalawag, anyway? And where&rsquo;s supper?
Are we supposed to fast till Christmas? I&rsquo;ve
smelled cakes baking around this place for
days and get set down to boiled meat and hominy.
Right now I could eat a hog, tail, squeal,
and all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s ready, Uncle.&rdquo; Emily hurried
out.</p>
<p>The General looked sharply at his wife.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t encourage this foolishness, my dear!
That boy has got to buckle down to his law.
Andy too, as soon as he&rsquo;s old enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those two&mdash;Miss Emily and your nephew&mdash;are
in love?&rdquo; asked Eaton.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not. After all, they are first cousins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel said nothing. Her gentle face, with
the round, firm chin, the dark eyes that held too
often a brooding look under arched brows,
grew thoughtful. Young love could be so beautiful!
Oh, she knew! She knew! Never through
all these years of struggle and anxiety and separation
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
had her own love faltered for this
stormy, dynamic, explosive man who was her
husband. His word was law, but even a just
law could be harsh when it bruised what was
young and sweet and trusting.</p>
<p>She went quietly out of the room and John
Eaton watched her go, saw a troubled look
darken the General&rsquo;s long face. A face hewn
from a hickory log, General Coffee had said
once, at New Orleans. Only the eyes could tolerate
pain and now they darkened with hurt,
following Rachel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sorrow&mdash;a great sorrow that she has no children
of her own,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;All her family&mdash;prolific
all of them. Her mother bore ten children
but her daughter has none. So she has to mother
a whole tribe and suffer every small disappointment
with them. These lads&mdash;Andrew Jackson
Donelson, young Andy and Andrew Hutchings
are sons to her&mdash;to me too. The problem is that
I have to hurt her with my firmness to make
men out of them. Too much softness in the
Donelson strain. I have been blessed by it, but
now I must fight against it and defeat it in those
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
boys. It&rsquo;s not easy to do, John, not for a man
who loves his wife as I love Rachel Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did not tell all your news, General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson shook his head. &ldquo;Let her
enjoy her Christmas. We&rsquo;ve had mighty few of
them together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A bell rang outside, and the General looked
in dismay at his hands. &ldquo;Supper&rsquo;s ready and I
forgot to wash. Come along with me, John.
You, George!&rdquo; He raised his voice in a shout.
&ldquo;Come here and mend this fire. Feels like
snow!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>

<p>Her room under the eaves of the Hermitage
was big and bright. The walls were covered
with paper in a small, gay design; there were
ruffled curtains at the windows. They looked
down on the meadow where even on this chilly
morning Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s mares and colts
picked at the frosty grass, lifting their heads
now and then to watch for Philip to come trudging
down from the stables to pour buckets of
water and grain into the feeding troughs.</p>
<p>Later, Emily knew, every animal would be
led back to the barns to be brushed and polished
ready to meet the General&rsquo;s critical eye.</p>
<p>The room was chilly. She had not bothered
to light the fire laid on the hearth. She had delayed
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
too long sitting up in her warm feather
bed, a shawl around her shoulders, reading and
rereading the letter. It made her heart beat
quickly and her cheeks burn to read it, and
when she pressed it against her heart it seemed
to glow there, warming her all over.</p>
<p>He loved her! In stiff, formal, slightly legal
language he had written it, plain to see, and the
words danced before her eyes and got into her
blood and did pirouettes there like little live
things with silver bells on their feet. Lovely
words! She kissed the letter now and then hid it
inside her Bible that lay on the table beside the
bed. What a pity that so much that was beautiful
and wonderful must be hidden or face the
chilly breath of adult disapproval!</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you marry your own cousin all your children
will be idiots,&rdquo; the older people said, looking
sombre, so desperately certain that they
were right. They were the elders and knew the
truth as young people could not be assumed to
know it, not having lived long enough for experience
to lay its cold blight upon them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave Andrew Jackson Donelson orders not
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
to come home,&rdquo; her uncle Jackson had said. The
thrill in Emily&rsquo;s heart was touched by panic
now as she hurried into her clothes. Her chemise,
chilly and crisp, the cramping stays, the
long white ruffled drawers and petticoats. Her
fingers were clumsy with cold and dread as she
struggled with the fastenings. For Jack was
coming! Already he was on the way. He must
be riding southward on that road from Kentucky
this minute, school left behind him&mdash;forever,
the letter said.</p>
<p>He knew where he was needed, he had written.
Aunt Jackson needed him. So would the
General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Circumstances have arisen that will make it
needful for our uncle to have assistance,&rdquo; ran
the letter. &ldquo;So I shall return to offer my aid and
I hope at that time that it will be proper for me
to make my addresses to your family, my dear
Emily, and request your hand in marriage.
Farewell, then, my love, till I enter the gate at
the Hermitage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There would be some kind of furious explosion
of displeasure from uncle Jackson, she
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
knew. He would be wrathy at being disobeyed,
but her experience with the tempestuous old
warrior led Emily to hope faintly that eventually
he would give in. Especially if aunt
Rachel should shed a few tears. That was his
history, storming, shouting orders and blasting
somebody with angry words, then softening instantly
if he saw a look of hurt in Rachel Jackson&rsquo;s
eyes.</p>
<p>Breakfast, when the General was away, was
usually a quiet meal at the Hermitage. Rachel
never slept very well and rose, still and determined,
setting about the multitude of tasks before
her, level-eyed and grave. But when Andrew
Jackson was at home there was hubbub.
He was always noisy and impatient in the mornings,
eating rapidly, summoning one servant
after another to give orders about the cattle,
the horses, the winter plowing. Negroes hurried
in, stood hat in hand listening obediently.
There was bedlam in the dining room when
Emily went down on this morning of Christmas
Eve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mix some bran with the oats for those nursing
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
mares,&rdquo; uncle Jackson was barking at
Philip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah, Mista Jackson. That Truxton filly,
she got sore foots. You want me to put tar and
grease on her foots, sah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get it too hot. You blistered all the hair
off last time. Here!&rdquo; Jackson slapped a piece of
ham between the halves of a huge biscuit and
handed it to the slave. &ldquo;Eat that and get moving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah. Thank you, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need somebody around this place to take
some of these chores off me,&rdquo; grumbled the
General. &ldquo;You, boy!&rdquo; He glared at Andrew,
Junior, who was wolfing down a plateful of
egg. &ldquo;You go see to that filly&rsquo;s feet. Got to learn.
Got to learn some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Young Andrew&rsquo;s sensitive mouth jerked and
his great eyes looked uneasy. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s raining,
Papa,&rdquo; he protested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may turn to snow. It felt very raw to me
when I went out to the dairy this morning,&rdquo;
Rachel put in gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It rained on me at Fort Mimms and Chalmette,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
snapped Andrew Jackson. &ldquo;You have
ridden miles in the rain, my love&mdash;so has this
fellow! What are you, son, a lump of salt that a
little rain can dissolve you? Or are you a paper
man cut out to dance on a string while somebody
picks a banjo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Papa, I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo; The boy hastily wiped his
lips. &ldquo;But Philip won&rsquo;t pay any attention to me.
He&rsquo;ll just tell me to keep out of the way of that
mare&rsquo;s heels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Make him obey you! How are you going to
be master of this place when I&rsquo;m gone if you
can&rsquo;t win the respect of the people? I may not
be here much longer. I never thought to live
long enough to sleep under this roof. Put that
stuff on your wrist and be sure it&rsquo;s not too hot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been going to die before spring ever
since I can remember, uncle Jackson,&rdquo; teased
Emily, when the boy had gone out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that cold he gets in his chest every time
he gets wet,&rdquo; Rachel said. &ldquo;And you get it too
and so does Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him get toughened up then,&rdquo; growled
the General. &ldquo;You spoil all these young ones,
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
my dear. Andy will have heavy responsibilities
when I&rsquo;m gone. He has to be trained to meet
them. I&rsquo;ve done fairly well with Andrew Jackson
Donelson for all you women trying continually
to soften him up. He&rsquo;ll make a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emily&rsquo;s heart was a bit happier. Uncle Jackson
did need someone to help him, as Jack had
written. She hoped that when Jack arrived,
when the storm of her uncle&rsquo;s ire had subsided,
that the General would welcome young Jack&rsquo;s
assistance. Inevitably, it was certain, the General
would be off again on some public service
or other. He protested, he fumed, but always,
when he was convinced that the call came from
the people, he obeyed, and Rachel would be
left alone again with the burden of this big
plantation.</p>
<p>The slaves were willing but aunt Rachel was
too soft with them, as she was too gentle, by the
General&rsquo;s standards, with the young people who
surrounded her. She was continually protesting
the overseer&rsquo;s decisions, protecting shirkers and
malcontents from punishment. She was too indulgent
with young Andy&mdash;a spoiled boy already
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
who, his cousin was convinced, was never
going to learn the value of money.</p>
<p>Rachel excused herself now and hurried out&mdash;to
see that the boy was adequately protected
from the weather, Emily suspected. She would
wrap him in coats and scarfs and when he returned
from the pasture or the stable he would
be put to bed, his feet soaked in hot mustard
water and a plaster of goose grease and pepper
on his chest if he so much as sneezed. Jack
would be out there, seeing to the mares, without
being told, his sweetheart believed worshipfully.
Jack would be a great help to aunt
Rachel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do my own room, aunt Rachel,&rdquo; she
called, as she went back through the house.
&ldquo;The girls have so much to do today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the big buttery Rachel turned the keys in
her hands anxiously. &ldquo;I declare I keep forgetting
how many people you counted, Emily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I counted fifty-two, but with the weather so
bad some of them might not get here. You know
how awful the roads get when it rains very long.
I wish it hadn&rsquo;t rained today. I was going to
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
have the boys cut some greens for me and decorate
the house. There&rsquo;s a big holly tree out
there beyond the tulip grove covered with red
berries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Send George,&rdquo; her aunt suggested. &ldquo;Mr.
Jackson gave George his old oilskin coat and a
pair of boots. You could put holly on the mantelpieces.
It would look right pretty but it would
dry out mighty quick, I&rsquo;m afraid. Emily, do you
reckon Mr. Jackson has any idea of going to
Russia? My patience, that would be a terrible
place to go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he had refused the appointment,
aunt Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. But he refused to be governor of
Florida too, and first thing I knew here I was
packing to go to Pensacola. Emily, all I ask is so
little&mdash;just to be allowed to stay in my home
with my husband and my family. I don&rsquo;t suit
proud places. Sometimes I feel that Mr. Jackson
must be ashamed of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, aunt Rachel!&rdquo; Emily gave the
quivering figure a quick hug. &ldquo;Uncle Jackson
thinks you are perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I wasn&rsquo;t getting so fat! It shortens my
breath so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her own room Emily quickly made her bed
and hung her clothes away in the big wardrobe.
Then she sat at the window again to read her
letter. Words she had passed over lightly before
in her happy daze now leaped out to trouble
her. &ldquo;Circumstances that have arisen,&rdquo; Jack had
written. A cold kind of prescience oppressed the
girl, shot through with a breathless excitement,
as though she had heard a trumpet blow.</p>
<p>It had come to her that there was always
about Andrew Jackson that atmosphere of great
events impending. Always when he seemed
most intimate, familiar and dear, there was a
cloak of aloofness shutting him in, a remote and
dedicated sort of mystery. As though even when
he was thinking homely thoughts&mdash;a lame mare,
a fire that needed replenishing&mdash;he was listening
to some far, calling drum. As though never
could he belong entirely to this Hermitage, this
woman that he loved, the young people he
scolded and indulged impartially. Emily was
very young and a trifle na&iuml;ve, but there was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
wisdom deep in her that recognized the destiny
that cloaked this man she loved like a garment
of silver, and her young mind dreaded it even
while it thrilled her.</p>
<p>She remembered John Eaton&rsquo;s words, that
people were saying that Andrew Jackson should
be President of the United States. She remembered,
too, aunt Rachel&rsquo;s positive declaration
that this he could not be! No palaces for her,
she had announced&mdash;but had there been a tinge
of desperation in that declaration? Did aunt
Rachel feel the pressure of destiny too, that remote
glory that invested her man on horseback?</p>
<p>It would be exciting, Emily was thinking, to
live in that new president&rsquo;s palace in Washington.
The British had burned it in retaliation for
the sack of Toronto by the American forces,
but it had been rebuilt, finer than ever, she had
heard, and now it was as important as Buckingham
Palace. Aunt Rachel had no wish to be a
queen in a palace. Only too well Emily knew
that aunt Rachel would be an unhappy queen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I would love it!&rdquo; she said suddenly
aloud.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>Silks and satins, servants bowing, diplomats
with medals and ribbons on their gleaming shirt
bosoms, sentries and bands playing, her
thoughts raced and thrilled.</p>
<p>If only she and Jack could be guests in that
palace! It was wonderful even to think about.
She sat in a roseate dream for a chilly half hour,
while her own fate hovered near, unfathomed.
The fate that would make her, Emily Donelson,
a young queen in a palace&mdash;and an unhappy
queen!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">3</span></h2>
<p>On Christmas Eve the servants all grew
tense and garrulous with excitement. The field
workers, freed from toil for three days, were in
and out of their cabins, hanging around the
kitchen door till Betty&rsquo;s sharp tongue sent
them packing. The rain had ended but the day
was bleak and cloudy with the air bringing a
threat of snow. But a wind rose and though it
whined in the great chimneys and sent whorls
of smoke and ashes drifting out into the rooms,
Rachel was grateful for the wind.</p>
<p>At least it would dry up the mud so that the
rutted, marshy road out to the Hermitage
would be passable for the carriages and wagons
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
of the Christmas guests. Some who had a long
way to come would arrive before night, and
there was a frantic activity of black women airing
blankets, ironing the stored dampness out of
bed linen, making down pallets in the upper
rooms and even in the hall. George lugged in
ticks freshly stuffed with hay and these were
beaten flat with whacking brooms before
feather beds and quilts were spread over them.</p>
<p>The long tables in the dining room were set
with the second-best linen and china. The ceremonial
draping with the finest cloths would
wait for Christmas morning. In the cellar the
General and black Joey counted bottles of Madeira,
of good Jamaica rum and peach brandy,
broached charred kegs of whisky pounding in
spigots, filling jugs that would be set out for the
holiday &ldquo;dram&rdquo; for every slave on the plantation.</p>
<p>In the smokehouse Rachel directed the slicing
of the heavy slabs of fat middling that
would go, one to every cabin. There would be
a chicken for each family too, and this year
every hand on the place would be measured
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
for a new pair of shoes. The shoemaker would
come and stay for weeks and the smell of the
cured hides would be heavy on the air, but at
least every one of the more than a hundred
black feet would be shod. That was the big
worry for Rachel, shoes. In summer the field
hands preferred to trudge behind a plow or
drag a cotton sack barefooted, but in winter the
frosty ground brought chills and lung fevers
and there was an endless sound of coughing in
the quarters and inevitably some of the people
died.</p>
<p>A fearful responsibility, all these black souls,
but today they were all happy and noisy, adding
to the confusion in the house by their laughter
and singing&mdash;singing hushed whenever the
voice of the master was heard belowstairs but
begun again as soon as a door slammed on
him.</p>
<p>In her room Emily lovingly folded the Christmas
gift she had knitted for Jack Donelson. A
crimson muffler with stripes and a fringe of
bright blue at either end. It narrowed a little
in the middle where she had knitted a bit too
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
tight, but she stretched it to make it even before
she wrapped it in a square of white paper
and tied it with a ribbon bow, sticking a tiny
bunch of holly jauntily on top. She had gifts for
aunt Rachel and uncle Jackson too, linen handkerchiefs
she had hemstitched with neat, tiny
stitches, then washed and bleached and ironed,
with Sary standing around to keep the irons
hot. She wrapped these too, along with the gifts
for her own family, aware of the curious eyes
of the two girls who were making an extra bed
in the corner of the room. Some of the cousins
would sleep in here, likely enough two of them
with her in her own bed.</p>
<p>They would giggle and whisper about their
beaus half the night and ply her with questions
that she would evade, quite certain that she was
fooling no one. She and Jack were a family anxiety,
she knew. It was all part of that silly old
superstition that cousins should not marry. Jack
had more brains than all his relatives put together,
she was fiercely certain; he was the
cleverest and steadiest of all the Donelson clan;
he was almost as smart as uncle Jackson. How
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
could a brilliant young man like Jack have children
that were idiots?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m not a stupid fool either!&rdquo; she said
suddenly, aloud.</p>
<p>The women, shaking out quilts, broke into
delighted laughter. &ldquo;No, Miss Emily, you sho&rsquo;
ain&rsquo;t no fool,&rdquo; cried the older one, &ldquo;You about
the smartest white Miss we got, savin&rsquo; Mis&rsquo;
Rachel herself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, &rsquo;Relia. Don&rsquo;t use that pillowcase.
It&rsquo;s got a rip in the seam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hit the very las&rsquo; one, Miss Emily. Done use
every pillowcase Mis&rsquo; Jackson got.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give it to me then. I&rsquo;ll mend it. We can&rsquo;t
have guests sleeping on rags.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Miss Mary Eastin, no ways. She want
everything mighty fine. Best we got ain&rsquo;t none
too good for Miss Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mary will sleep with me. She always
does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her hair mighty pretty. Smooth and shiny
as a new colt. Got a nice long nose too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all got long noses. It&rsquo;s the Donelson
curse. Mine&rsquo;s longest of all. All of us but aunt
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
Rachel. Somehow it passed her by,&rdquo; sighed
Emily, threading a needle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t flat like mine, anyhow,&rdquo; &rsquo;Relia echoed
the sigh. &ldquo;If the good Lord was to give me my
dearest wish it would be to have a nice long
nose like you got, Miss Emily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t nobody satisfy,&rdquo; stated Becky, the
other maid. &ldquo;White folks all wantin&rsquo; hair be
curly. Colored folks all putting grease on they
hair, make it straight. You reckon we be white
when we git to Heaven, Miss Emily?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Law, we be angels with big white wings,&rdquo;
declared &rsquo;Relia. &ldquo;Lord don&rsquo;t want no black
angels around, he got to make us white. I wants
me a pyure white robe, white as Mis&rsquo; Rachel&rsquo;s
tablecloth. I goin&rsquo; put on my robe and sing
praises to the Throne, day and night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to sing tonight, Becky&mdash;all of
you? It wouldn&rsquo;t be Christmas if you people
didn&rsquo;t build a big fire out there behind
the smokehouse and all gather round and
sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look a little like snow,&rdquo; said Becky, peering
out the window. Becky hated the cold. She
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
burned more wood in her cabin than any other
servant on the place, Emily had heard her aunt
complain. From the window now she could see
the wagon coming down the lane loaded with
firewood, George walking beside the team,
cracking his whip and shouting. Great fires
would roar in every fireplace in the house, over
the holidays. Rachel Jackson was nervous about
fire. Someday the General was going to burn
the Hermitage to the ground, she was always
prophesying.<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>A carriageload of cousins and aunts arrived
shortly after the family had finished dinner, and
there was a confusion of greetings, band boxes
and parcels to be carried in, shawls, bonnets and
cloaks laid off to be hung up by maids, cold
hands and feet to be warmed by the fires, the
scurry of excited children. Then all the food
had to be warmed up and brought in again and
the guests fed.</p>
<p>Emily hurried about, setting out plates, getting
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
down glasses for the General, who insisted
that everyone must have a tot of hot spiced rum
to ward off a chill. She had little chance to slip
to the front of the house to watch the drive
from the windows, but while the company were
eating, with Rachel hovering around and the
General being the affable host, she did steal
away to stand behind the long curtains, searching
the approaching avenue anxiously.</p>
<p>Dusk was beginning to gather under the
great trees. The smoke from the many chimneys
eddied and settled to the ground. A few thin
snowflakes drifted by on the wind, then drops
of rain spattered the windowpanes. Bad
weather for a young man riding alone. So many
things could happen on a long journey. A horse
stumbling at a ford, footpads on the road lying
in wait for a solitary traveler, even the danger
from Indians was not ended.</p>
<p>She was growing more tense with anxiety by
the minute but she must not betray her unease,
must keep her demeanor calm and be most surprised
of all when Jack came riding in, or her
uncle would never forgive her for hiding her
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
letter. She had let the curtains fall when Andrew,
Junior, came up behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who you watching for, Emmy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She managed a light laugh. &ldquo;Anybody! I hope
if more are coming tonight they&rsquo;ll get here before
dark. We&rsquo;d better light the candles. It&rsquo;s
going to be a gloomy night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;George is getting his fire going,&rdquo; Andy
looked from the window. &ldquo;I suppose I&rsquo;ll have to
go out and help Papa dole out the Christmas
Eve gifts all around. Looky yonder, the people
are coming out with their cups and mugs and
sacks already! You&rsquo;ll have to light the candles,
Emily. I&rsquo;ve got to go out and be Young Marse
Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honor, Andy. There are a lot of Donelson
boys. You were the one chosen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. It&rsquo;s hard to live up to sometimes,
&rsquo;specially when Jack&rsquo;s around. I know he&rsquo;s
smarter than I am and Jack&rsquo;s a fool for work and
duty as I get reminded all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be jealous. After all, they did
pick you to be their son and heir. You&rsquo;ll have
everything, being Andrew Jackson&rsquo;s son.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have to admit, though, that Papa&rsquo;s a
hard man to follow. Came up from the direst
kind of poverty, made it all for himself. I hear
that too. And how he got thrown into that prison
where his brother died, because he wouldn&rsquo;t
black some British officer&rsquo;s boots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was no older than you are now, then,
Andy. He&rsquo;s just trying to inspire you. You&rsquo;d better
hurry. I hear the cellar door slamming. That
means uncle Jackson and Joey are fetching out
the jugs. Oh, Heaven, there&rsquo;s aunt Rachel out
there without her cloak! I&rsquo;ll get it before she
takes a chill. Run, Andy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under the big trees all the Negroes on the
place were gathering. George had persuaded
the big bonfire to burn in spite of the thin, misting
rain. Children, black and white, crowded
close to it, their voices shrill with excitement.
Little Negro boys poked sticks into the blazing
fire, waved them smoking in air, dancing about
till Betty laid about her with a switch, ordering
the brands extinguished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You set the young Misses&rsquo; dresses afire,&rdquo; she
screamed at them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>On long trestles the parcels of meat were laid
out and the chickens, tied by the feet and
squawking, were brought from the chicken
house and handed around, one hen or rooster to
a family. Instantly there was a bedlam of
screaming joy, chickens&rsquo; necks being wrung,
cries of, &ldquo;Thank you, Massa, thank you,
Mist&rsquo;iss!&rdquo; The General with Andy beside him
and Joey at hand to lift a jug stood at the end
of the table. A line formed, cups in hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No crowding now&mdash;and no sneaking back
to the end of the line for a second drink!&rdquo;
warned Andrew Jackson.</p>
<p>Headless chickens flopped on the ground,
prodded by shrieking little Negroes with sticks.
Emily wrapped a heavy cloak around her aunt&rsquo;s
shoulders, pulled her own shawl tighter as they
watched the line of people file by to receive
their portion of Christmas cheer. Even the
small ones got a tot, weakened with water, and
as each child passed Andrew Jackson tweaked
a lock of kinky hair or pulled an ear, sending
the small black person off into a hysteria of
shrieks and giggles.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>George had put a great washpot over the
flames and when the water was hot the women
would douse their fowls in the steaming cauldron
and there would be a great chattering and
ripping off of feathers, but before that all the
people would gather in a phalanx to sing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must go in and light all the candles,&rdquo;
Emily told a group of women. &ldquo;The house must
be bright when they sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You go, Emily,&rdquo; Rachel said. &ldquo;I ought to
stay here. Becky and Dilsey both wanted that
white rooster and they&rsquo;re sure to get into a
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Mr. Field attend to it. It&rsquo;s his business
to keep the people in order, aunt Rachel. You
are a hostess with a houseful of guests, you have
enough to worry you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel went reluctantly into the house, and
presently every room was ablaze with firelight
and candlelight. The other women and children
drifted in, and Andy came too, standing before
the fire balancing uneasily on first one foot, then
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mama,&rdquo; he began abruptly, &ldquo;you know Papa
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
said he was going to give me that chestnut colt.
Why can&rsquo;t he give it to me for Christmas? He
gave Jack the sorrel and promised the chestnut
to me when it was grown. Now every time I
speak to Philip about it he says it&rsquo;s not old
enough to break yet. A two-year-old colt ought
to be old enough to break to the saddle. You
know that, Mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel looked harassed. &ldquo;Son, Philip knows
about the horses more than I. Your Papa has
every confidence in Philip&rsquo;s judgment. You
have horses to ride. Good safe horses too. And
that new saddle and bridle and everything.
Goodness knows they cost plenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young to ride a stallion colt,
Andy,&rdquo; put in one of his Donelson aunts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should ride some old bag of bones like
Duke, I suppose?&rdquo; flared the boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duke is a noble old horse,&rdquo; stated Rachel
sternly. &ldquo;He carried your Papa through two
wars. He&rsquo;s earned his rest and feed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he still pays for his keep by dancing on
three feet whenever anybody whistles &lsquo;Yankee
Doodle&rsquo;,&rdquo; laughed Emily. &ldquo;Andy, you&rsquo;re only
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
fourteen. Plenty of time for you to wrestle fractious
stallion colts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could be killed,&rdquo; worried his mother,
&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ve got to live to comfort me in my
old age. Sometimes I feel like it&rsquo;s coming on
mighty fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, Rachel, you&rsquo;ve got twenty good
years ahead of you,&rdquo; argued one of her sisters-in-law,
&ldquo;and all the struggle is behind. This fine
house now&mdash;and everything fine in it and all the
worry behind you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only they don&rsquo;t decide that Mr. Jackson
has to save the country in some other awful
place far from home!&rdquo; sighed Rachel. &ldquo;I declare,
with millions of men now in this country there
ought to be enough to keep it going peacefully
without Mr. Jackson being dragged away from
this place again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is,&rdquo; remarked the other woman,
&ldquo;that Andrew Jackson was never born for peace.
Not that he starts any trouble but the minute
anything does start Andrew is the man they look
for to put an end to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d start a fight soon enough if anybody
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
picked on Mama,&rdquo; declared Andy. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s done
that already. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s carrying that bullet
around right close to his heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy!&rdquo; protested Emily, shocked at the
quick whitening of Rachel&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>The Dickinson duel was never spoken of in
her presence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was very bad taste, Andy,&rdquo; reproved
his aunt, &ldquo;and you should know better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s true!&rdquo; protested the boy, his voice
breaking in a contralto tremolo. &ldquo;Even when I
was little, boys used to yell at me that my father
had killed a man&mdash;on account of Mama.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel walked away quickly and they heard
the door of her room close.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andy, how dreadful&mdash;on Christmas Eve!&rdquo;
scolded an aunt, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; urged Emily, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll want to be alone,
aunt Mary. But I&rsquo;m ashamed of Andy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everybody picks on me,&rdquo; mourned the
boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go outside and help your father. And remember
that there are things never mentioned
in your mother&rsquo;s presence. One of them is
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
Charles Dickinson and that tragic duel that
happened before you were ever born.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa did kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My boy, I hope that when you are grown a
man you will find a woman as fine and faithful
as Rachel Jackson,&rdquo; said the older woman
gravely. &ldquo;If you are so fortunate as to win a wife
like that and a man cast slurs on her in public,
I think you will be moved to kill him too. Now
go on out of here before I get the itch to box
your ears, big as you are!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">4</span></h2>
<p>In her room Rachel stood before her tall
chest, her hands shaking, her throat cramping
with an agonizing pain. Always in spring, when
all about was new growth and beauty burgeoning
the old terror twenty years past came back
for a little to haunt her. Now Andy&rsquo;s callous
taunts had brought it again out of its grave to
tear at her tender heart.</p>
<p>Always it was the same. She saw herself again
sitting in the carriage beside that race track
where the General&rsquo;s fine horse Truxton, and a
horse called Ploughboy owned by Charles Dickinson
and his father were running a race.
Gathered around the course was an enormous
concourse of people: the women in carriages
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
and on horseback wearing their new spring
bonnets gay with flowers and ribbons, or flowing
habits of bright velvet; the men jaunty in
tight breeches strapped under their ankles,
ruffled shirts and tall beaver hats. An April
wind was blowing sweet off the fields.</p>
<p>It was all as sharply clear to Rachel, here in
her big room dimly lighted by one candle, as
it had been on that fateful day when Truxton
had gone lame in the third heat of the race.</p>
<p>She could even hear again her own voice saying
na&iuml;vely and more loudly than she had intended,
&ldquo;If Truxton hadn&rsquo;t gone lame he would
have left Ploughboy out of sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could hear too that loud, sneering voice
that still crackled in her ears though the young
man who had spoken had lain twenty years in
his grave. Angry and raucous from a bit too
much drink, Charles Dickinson had shouted,
&ldquo;About as far out of sight as Mrs. Jackson left
her first husband when she ran off with the
General!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It comforted her still to remember that she
had not been the one who repeated that jeering
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
insult to Andrew Jackson. But there had been
many ready to turn the knife in an old wound,
to drag out again and bandy about the old, sordid
story of Lewis Robards, who had married
Rachel and discarded her, of the aborted divorce
that had clouded Rachel Robards Jackson&rsquo;s
second marriage.</p>
<p>A chill ran over her body now as she remembered
the furious, insulting letters that had been
written, the General&rsquo;s cold terrible rage, the
town and county taking sides, eventually the
irrevocable challenge. Her hands shook as she
opened a drawer in the chest. Well hidden
there under lavender-scented linen lay the
browning copy of a paper that Andrew Jackson
would have destroyed instantly, had he known
that she still hoarded it. It was dated on the
23rd of May, 1806, and the lines that were hastily
scrawled upon it were burned on Rachel
Jackson&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p><i>On Friday, the 30th. Inst, we agree to meet
at Harrison&rsquo;s Mills, in Red River County, State
of Kentucky for the Purpose of settling an Affair
of Honor, between Andrew Jackson and</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_56">56</span>
<i>Charles Dickinson, Esq. Further arrangements
to be made. It is understood that the Meeting
will be held at seven o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</i></p>
<p>It was signed with the General&rsquo;s familiar
scrawl and the neater hand of young Dickinson.</p>
<p>Charles Dickinson had been so young! Rachel
ached now with remembering the anguish of
dread for her own beloved and for the young
wife and baby of the youth Andrew Jackson
had set out across the Kentucky line that May
morning to kill, if he could&mdash;if he were not himself
slain by a youth known to be one of the
most famous shots in Tennessee.</p>
<p>Duels were illegal in Tennessee so Jackson
had started the day before with his friend,
John Overton, for the long ride into Kentucky.
He had tried to slip away without Rachel&rsquo;s
knowledge, tried to belittle the danger. And he
had come home with a bullet close to his heart,
too near to be safely removed by the surgeons,
and that bullet he carried yet. But Charles
Dickinson had been brought home dead and
for a year the town had seethed with furious
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
criticism of the man who had survived that duel,
Andrew Jackson. The affair had almost ended
his public career. Rachel had known some
moments when she wished that the tragedy
had made it impossible for Andrew Jackson
ever to be chosen for any high emprise again.</p>
<p>It had weighed heavily on her heart for years
that the affair had been on her account, and
there had been a long, unspoken family pact that
the duel was never to be mentioned. She had
nursed her husband for weeks through that hot
summer, and he had hated the inactivity while
Rachel was grateful that the spring ran cool
and deep and the great trees gave comforting
shade, and that she had her husband, wounded
and restless as he was, by her side. He had not
desired that tragic engagement, she knew.
Faced with no honorable means of evading it,
he had fought fairly according to the rules and
borne his wound without capitalizing upon it.</p>
<p>She put away the old agreement, smoothed
her hair and the lace of her collar, rubbed a bit
of cotton dipped in rice powder over her
swollen eyelids. This was Christmas Eve, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
past was past, though Truxton&rsquo;s colts still
ambled over the meadows, some of them growing
old as the Jacksons were growing old. Perhaps
they would have no more Christmas Eves
under this roof, this proud house that they
loved. Nothing must mar this holiday. She
would hurry out and tell Andy that he was forgiven.
The boy was impulsive and thoughtless.
He had not meant to wound her.</p>
<p>The house was full of voices; children being
led upstairs to bed reluctant and protesting,
but outside were voices too, the songs of the
black people gathered to sing to their master
and mistress. Rachel snatched up a shawl,
wrapped her head and shoulders in it and went
out to stand and listen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Christmas is a-comin&rsquo;, the goose is getting
fat.</i></p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Please to put a penny in the ole man&rsquo;s hat</i>,&rdquo;
caroled the slaves.</p>
<p>She saw her husband standing bareheaded
near the fire, his hair blowing in the winter
wind, the firelight casting deep shadows under
his eyes. He had a hand on Andy&rsquo;s shoulder, an
<span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
arm around Emily. No one heeded the mist that
blew on the wind. Some of the older women
were already picking their chickens on the lee
side of the smokehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Go down, Moses, &rsquo;way down in Egypt&rsquo;s
lan&rsquo;</i>,&rdquo; trilled a high voice, Becky&rsquo;s. The humming
chorus swelled, burst into tremendous
melody. &ldquo;<i>Tell ole Phar&rsquo;oh,&mdash;let my people go!</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Go down, Moses! Go down, Andrew Jackson!
To Tohopeka, to Mobile, to New Orleans,
to Pensacola. Go down, Andrew Jackson, and
set a people free! No, no, moaned the heart of
Rachel. Never any more. This was home, this
was their Hermitage, this was Christmas Eve.
Her eyes searched the air, challenged the air,
the Heavens, as though somewhere out there
in the murky dark lurked fate in wait for them,
a prescience that would not lift.</p>
<p>Was it a charm or a curse that invested her
man on horseback? What dark Nemesis had
hovered over that little cabin back in the North
Carolina sandhills where he had been born?
What strange power had preserved him when
all his family succumbed to the hardships of
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
that time of bitter war? What power of destiny
had brought him up, an orphaned waif, led him
through so many conflicts, made him a firebrand
and a leader whom men would follow as
they followed a flag?</p>
<p>Sick and coughing, his frail health her constant
anxiety, he inspired strong men. Something
was brewing now. Rachel felt it, but she
must hold her tongue and quiet her unease with
the drug of hope.</p>
<p>A horse came trotting up the drive and
Rachel saw Emily start forward eagerly. Then
the girl stopped as a slim figure in oilskin slid
from the saddle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Ralph!&rdquo; Rachel hurried forward to greet
the young artist, Ralph Earl. Off and on, for
many years, the portrait painter had made his
home at the Hermitage. He had done a fine
portrait of the General, wooed and won Jane
Caffrey, Rachel&rsquo;s niece. There had been a fine
wedding in the old log house that still stood
there in the yard, but gentle Jane had lived only
a year. Now Earl was a saddened and lonely
man and Rachel mothered him after her habit
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
with all young, unmothered creatures. &ldquo;How
fine that you got back from the East for Christmas,
Ralph!&rdquo; she cried, taking his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to paint your picture,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The
General will never give me any peace till I do
your portrait, aunt Rachel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddlesticks!&rdquo; She led him into the house.
&ldquo;You come get warm and dry this minute before
you take a ptisic. I&rsquo;ll make a hot toddy for
you, myself. And you don&rsquo;t want to paint a picture
of a fat old woman like me. Nobody would
look at it. We&rsquo;d have to hang it in the wash-house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A portrait of you might be hung on the walls
of some very splendid place, aunt Rachel,&rdquo;
Earl argued, handing his damp garments to a
servant.</p>
<p>She looked at him in sudden alarm. &ldquo;Now
whatever do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;just an idea I had,&rdquo; he soothed, seeing
her perturbation. &ldquo;People keep getting notions
about what Andrew Jackson could do for this
country. I hear about them&mdash;traveling around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She clutched at his arm. &ldquo;No, Ralph&mdash;whatever
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
their notions are, he&rsquo;s not going to go dashing
off again on some wild adventure or other.
He&rsquo;s not strong, you know that. He&rsquo;ll get that
lung fever again and it almost caused his death
last winter. And besides,&rdquo;&mdash;her eyes misted and
her voice croaked&mdash;&ldquo;he&rsquo;d have to leave our
home! Our Hermitage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think of what great things could happen
to you, aunt Rachel! Someday you might
be one of the greatest ladies in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a great lady.&rdquo; She held
tight to the cold hand he had laid upon her
cheek. &ldquo;I want to stay here and raise young
Andy and Andrew Hutchings. I want to see
Emily well married and all our people taken
care of. I never want to have to go dragging
out again to make calls and leave cards and
smile till my face aches. I have had enough of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the same I&rsquo;m going to paint your portrait,&rdquo;
he insisted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You paint Emily. She&rsquo;s filling out, she&rsquo;s going
to be a beauty. The General&rsquo;s got that little picture
of me that Anna Peale painted the year of
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
that New Orleans battle. He carries it around
with him all the time, though he wrote to me
once and said he didn&rsquo;t need it, that he had my
picture engraved on his heart. Nobody could
ask for anything more beautiful than that,
Ralph, no woman alive. He wouldn&rsquo;t engrave
a picture of me as I am now, on his heart&mdash;an
old lady getting fat and out of breath!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he would,&rdquo; said Earl. &ldquo;I think he
would prize any picture of you, aunt Rachel,
more than his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s coming in,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I must get
his bed warm so he won&rsquo;t cough all night. You&rsquo;ll
have to sleep with Andy tonight. We&rsquo;ve got a
houseful already and more coming. And Ralph,
don&rsquo;t you let the General get notions about
rushing off to be somebody important. It&rsquo;s time
he took care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell him, aunt Rachel. But you know
Andrew Jackson. If any call came from the
people to serve anywhere, no one could hold
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said sadly. &ldquo;Not even I!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">5</span></h2>
<p>Bugles and drums before dawn had
trained Andrew Jackson to waken early. He tiptoed
about in the dark, cracking a toe and muttering
in irritation, fumbled into his clothes by
the lingering glow of a dying fire, not wanting
to light a candle and wake Rachel.</p>
<p>Then he discovered that she was already gone
from the bed, her full ruffled night rail was
spread out neatly to air, her cap perched on
the post of the bed. Instantly his voice rose in
the familiar falsetto shout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, George! Get in here and mend this
fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The alacrity with which the man appeared,
loaded to the chin with lightwood, betrayed
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
that he had been waiting near for a summons.
&ldquo;Yes, sah, Gin&rsquo;ral Jackson! Christmas gif&rsquo;,
sah!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas gift! I&rsquo;ll gift you with my boot if
you don&rsquo;t stir yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah!&rdquo; George burst into delighted
chuckles. He knew his master well. &ldquo;Mist&rsquo;iss
say, don&rsquo;t disturb Marse Jackson, she say, let
Marse Jackson git he rest. I git a fine fire here
toreckly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The embers stirred, the lightwood crackled
and flamed. Andrew Jackson liked fire to roar
as he liked horses to gallop and men to spring
into action when he shouted an order. George
swept the hearth and set the fire tools in order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas gif&rsquo;, Gin&rsquo;ral,&rdquo; he repeated meekly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; Jackson tossed a two-shilling piece.
George caught it in midair, grinned and bowed
elaborately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thankee, sah! Thankee! Does you go to town
I git you to buy me some store galluses, please,
sah? I like some red galluses, wid big brass
buckles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your money. Buy candy with it. I&rsquo;ll
<span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
get you some red galluses. How you hitch your
britches up now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis yere piece of rope. But it mighty near
wore out and Mister Field say he goin&rsquo; beat the
next nigger cut off any his rope. Thankee, sah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now I reckon every hand on the place will
have to have red galluses with brass buckles,&rdquo;
snorted the General. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re getting measured
for shoes tomorrow, George. You wash your
feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sah, sho will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christmas morning! How few Christmas
Days he had ever spent in his own home, Andrew
Jackson was thinking. On the march, in
cheerless camps with lonely men, in that strange
mansion in Pensacola, riding eastward roads
through Tennessee to Philadelphia, to Washington.
And now perhaps the road eastward
lay ahead of him again. He dreaded telling
Rachel, rooted as she was to this hillside, fixed
as one of the old trees and removed with almost
as much agony. She might even refuse to take
the road again. He might face more endless
months of loneliness. He looked at the little
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
gold-framed miniature that had never been far
from his gaze since it had been painted so
many years ago.</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s direct eyes looked from it, her strong
mouth was relaxed in a little smile, the lace cap
and fichu she wore softened her high brow,
where the dark hair curled, her rounded chin.
Long earrings gave her an effect of gayety that
always made him happy when he studied the
picture. She had looked like that once&mdash;in
Natchez where he had married her, believing
her divorced from sadistic Lewis Robards. She
needed gayety. She had had too much of responsibility,
she had seen too much of sorrow.</p>
<p>Today should be gay. He would have fiddlers
in and let the young folks dance. He would open
the best wine and make a big bowl of punch.
He jabbed his feet into his boots hurriedly,
rejecting the heavy braided coat for a lighter
hunting jacket of leather.</p>
<p>The house was fragrant with the evergreen
Emily had hung about, and there was a comfortable
odor of coffee. In the dining room
Rachel was bustling about a long table following
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
Hannah who puffed and sputtered at two
children who kept diving, squealing, under the
table to peer out from beneath the cloth and
pinch Hannah&rsquo;s fat legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&mdash;here!&rdquo; barked the General. &ldquo;You tads
leave Hannah alone. Come out of there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instantly the pair, in nightgowns and barefooted,
swarmed up his long legs like squirrels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas gift, uncle Jackson! Christmas
gift!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He planted a spank on each of two small
rears. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s your Christmas gift. Now go
and get your clothes on. When you come down
properly dressed you&rsquo;ll get your Christmas gift.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother&rsquo;s asleep, we don&rsquo;t know where our
clothes are,&rdquo; protested a little boy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wake her up. Wake everybody up. It&rsquo;s
Christmas morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir!&rdquo; The two obeyed with alacrity, rushing
out shrieking, &ldquo;Wake up! Wake up! Christmas
gift!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to get breakfast over so we can set
the tables for dinner,&rdquo; said Rachel, &ldquo;and all the
people are slow and lazy this morning. Betty
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
says the oven won&rsquo;t get hot for her spoon bread
and Dilsey cut the bacon too thick and then
went off in a sulk when I scolded her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them all up,&rdquo; threatened the General.
He strode out through the house to the bricked
passage to the kitchen, pulled on a rope dangling
from a pole. The slave bell clanged loud
and long.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My patience,&rdquo; Rachel exclaimed, &ldquo;the neighbors
will think the house is afire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Git them triflin&rsquo; niggers stirrin&rsquo;, anyways,&rdquo;
said Hannah.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get the mugs for the children, Hannah, and
tell &rsquo;Relia to get herself upstairs to help the
young ladies. And I want every bed made up
right away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hannah said, &ldquo;Yas&rsquo;m.&rdquo; She loved ordering the
other maids around, being middle-aged, faithful
and privileged.</p>
<p>Breakfast was a gay and noisy meal. Emily
was happy with a new gold chain and locket,
kissing everybody impartially as she danced
around the table. Rachel had a pearl brooch
with a small blue stone in the center and yards
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
of white satin for caps and collars. One little
boy pushed his toy monkey around the table,
perched it on people&rsquo;s shoulders till Andrew,
Junior, said impatiently, &ldquo;Oh, quit it, boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you so excited about?&rdquo; the General
asked Emily, when he had followed her into
the parlor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, uncle Jackson, it&rsquo;s Christmas! And my
lovely locket. You shouldn&rsquo;t have given me anything
so fine. I&rsquo;ll put a lock of your hair in it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put some young fellow&rsquo;s hair in it&mdash;the right
fellow, mind you! And were you looking down
that road to see if Christmas was coming?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. Just more company. Aunt Rachel
says there should be ten more. Thank goodness
the rain stopped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Froze a little.&rdquo; He took his pipe from the
mantel, and the deep tobacco jar. &ldquo;Kill hogs
next week if the cold weather holds. Emily, get
your aunt out of that dining room. Make her rest
if you can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try, but you know aunt Rachel. She
won&rsquo;t believe the Christmas dinner is fit to eat
unless she has dipped a spoon in every dish. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
promised to oversee setting the tables as soon
as the girls have cleared away. They&rsquo;re all excited
and they&rsquo;ll get all the forks crooked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In some ways it will be good for Rachel to
get away for a while,&rdquo; he mused, half to himself,
as he lifted the coal from the fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Away&mdash;where?&rdquo; Emily stiffened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I shall have to return to the Senate,
my dear. Have you forgotten that I have been
elected United States Senator from Tennessee?
Of course, when I go back I shall want my wife
to go with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Jackson, Jack wrote me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;did Mister Andrew
Jackson Donelson write to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>That he loved me</i> leaped like a lovely tongue
of fairy flame into her mind. She blinked very
fast to keep uncle Jackson from reading it in her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said something about circumstances&mdash;about
a ground swell in Kentucky&mdash;he was
rather vague&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He frowned, then his face lightened and his
mouth quirked up at one corner in a halfway
<span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
impish grin. &ldquo;So young Andrew has been hearing
rumblings in Kentucky.&rdquo; Always he had
refused to call his nephew by the family nickname
of Jack. &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t he write to me? Kentucky
is the fighting ground of our friend Henry
Clay. If there are any honors to be handed out,
the Speaker of the House would like them for
himself, no doubt? I will tell you this much,
Emily, and you will keep it to yourself. In spite
of all I can do, I have friends determined to push
me into the forefront again. Now, they are
talking about running me for the highest office
in this land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that would be a great honor, uncle Jackson.
Why must we keep it a secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to spoil her Christmas. Some
women would be elated at a chance to spend a
winter in Washington, move in important circles,
perhaps be elevated to the highest position
in this land. But not your aunt Rachel. I want
to talk her into the right mood, or she might
refuse to leave here and then I&rsquo;d be separated
from her again for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she must go! I won&rsquo;t let her refuse,&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
argued Emily. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll buy her some beautiful
clothes. She can be a fine lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s already a fine lady,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;but
she&rsquo;d rather go on here dosing the bellyache of
the most worthless hand I own than to be invited
to dinner in the proudest house in the
country. I love her for her simplicity, and I
want her to enjoy peace as long as she can, so
say nothing about any plans, Emily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, uncle Jackson, but you could be wrong
about aunt Rachel. The thing she wants more
than anything is to be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what I most desire is to be with her.
I am singularly blessed. It troubles me now
that I grow old that the people will not let me
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could say no. You could refuse when
they thrust these responsibilities upon you,&rdquo;
she reminded him, grave beyond her years.</p>
<p>He lifted his gaunt shoulders in a ponderous
sigh. &ldquo;This is a great country, Emily, my child.
Where else could a gangling, country boy with
no fortune and little education fight his way up
to where he is honored as I have been honored
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
by my countrymen? I owe America a debt.
Speaking of debts,&rdquo; his mood changed, his face
grew into a sardonic grimace, &ldquo;the question is&mdash;where
is the money coming from to pay for all
this pride and eminence? It costs like the devil
to live in Washington and the crops this year
were disappointing. As things stand now I owe
about twice as much as I&rsquo;m worth. Of course
there are a lot of people who owe me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then make them pay,&rdquo; she counseled. &ldquo;And
you should never have spent so much money for
this locket, uncle Jackson. I love you without
gifts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I can&rsquo;t buy a present for a pretty girl,
I&rsquo;ll let them cart me off to a debtor&rsquo;s prison!&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;As for asking my friends to repay
money I&rsquo;ve loaned them, that&rsquo;s something a
gentleman can&rsquo;t do, Emily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t be a gentleman,&rdquo; she suggested
boldly. &ldquo;Be a politician. They seem to be able
to ask for anything they want without any
qualms whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He laughed so loudly that some of the
guests came hurrying in to hear the joke. &ldquo;When
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
James Monroe makes me ambassador to Mexico
or Russia or some other heathen spot on this
globe, I&rsquo;m going to make Emily Donelson my
prime counselor,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This gal has brains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emily laughed and hurried out to help her
aunt. She was feeling easier in her mind. If
uncle Jackson was harassed about money, he
might be relieved at hearing that Jack was not
going back to school. There was young Andy
coming along to be educated and Andrew
Hutchings, also a ward of the Jacksons, and it
must cost a tremendous lot to run this huge
plantation and care for all the people, white
and black. And anything aunt Rachel wanted
she had, whether it was a pair of silk mitts, a
ten-dollar hat or an expensive suite of furniture
shipped in at enormous expense from halfway
across the country. Somewhere Andrew Jackson
found the money to gratify Rachel&rsquo;s every desire.</p>
<p>That expensive saddle for Andy&mdash;and her
locket&mdash;and it was very certain in her mind that
there were some things that the General needed
for himself. He needed new clothes anyway.
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
She had noted the shabbiness of his braided
coat, shiny at the elbows, and all his waistcoats
were worn on the edges.</p>
<p>Destiny might have planned great things for
Andrew Jackson through his lifetime, decided
his niece, but fate had certainly been stingy
with the practical rewards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">6</span></h2>
<p>The heavy damask cloths had been spread.
Another carriage full of cousins and aunts and
uncles arrived to fill the house with more confusion.
Mary Eastin and some of the other girls
came to help Emily direct the placing of the
great piles of china plates, the gleaming goblets
and compotes that would be filled with uncle
Jackson&rsquo;s wine and aunt Rachel&rsquo;s preserves and
relishes. The heavy soup ladle was rubbed till
it glittered, a mound of apples and nuts was
heaped on a tray which Emily edged with holly.</p>
<p>Mary Eastin, very young and eager, had a
cameo face and a lilting laugh. Life would always
be gay for Mary. A president&rsquo;s nephew
would one day find her irresistible, but now she
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
was a dancing sprite, doing pirouettes with a
vinegar cruet for a partner, getting in everybody&rsquo;s
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll break something, Mary. Do go and
coax uncle Jackson to tootle on his new flute,&rdquo;
urged Emily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He makes such silly noises on it,&rdquo; protested
Mary, &ldquo;and he screws up his face till I&rsquo;m scared
to death I&rsquo;ll laugh and offend him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he loves it and it gets politics out of his
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary grabbed Emily&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Emmy, he&rsquo;s
coming isn&rsquo;t he? I can see it sticking out all over
you. Emmy, I think all these stuffy old people
are crazy. If I had a boy in love with me, I&rsquo;d
have him, no matter if every Donelson alive
croaked themselves to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, for Heavens&rsquo; sake, hush! Things are
going to be bad enough&mdash;I&rsquo;m just holding my
breath.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo; Mary&rsquo;s eyes were
full of stars. &ldquo;Let me tell you something though&mdash;don&rsquo;t
you start out being a dutiful wife like
aunt Rachel. A woman can get herself simply
<span class="pb" id="Page_79">79</span>
<i>subjugated</i> by being so worshipful. I mean to
keep my spirit and my personality, whoever I
marry. Aunt Rachel&rsquo;s kind of wife is going out
of fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Emily bent her brows together. Of course
Jack would expect a dutiful wife. Hadn&rsquo;t he
been trained by uncle Jackson, who had never
known any other mode of life except to be
master in his house? Jack would expect his
wife to be a gracious copy of aunt Rachel&mdash;with
a bit more style perhaps, and more ease in company,
Emily amended, with no disloyalty. Aunt
Rachel was good. She did not need a flair for
clever conversation or the sly, pretty arts by
which some women kept men enthralled, but as
Mary had said, times were changing. Women
even went to colleges now and read deep books.</p>
<p>Rachel came in then, followed by Hannah
and the maids, all carrying steaming dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you moppets whispering about?&rdquo;
she asked. &ldquo;Beaus, I&rsquo;ll wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;re far too young, aunt Rachel. And
too utterly well bred,&rdquo; Mary replied saucily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plotting against the whites,&rdquo; evaded Emily.
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in that dish, Dilsey? It smells wonderful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dilsey&rsquo;s candied yams are always perfect,&rdquo;
Rachel said. &ldquo;Mary, you run and fetch all the
boys and tell them to carry in every extra chair.
And tell Andy to have George ring the bell.
Your uncle and the other men have likely wandered
off to the stables. I never have put a meal
on the table yet that didn&rsquo;t have to compete for
their concern with some colt. Hannah, we&rsquo;ll set
the ham at this end, and the turkeys at the
other. Levin can carve at this other table and
Mr. Jackson here, and you and Dilsey can serve
the children their plates. That small table makes
it crowded, but I couldn&rsquo;t bear to make the
little ones wait. I like all my family together at
Christmas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her family, all the Donelsons, whom the
General, having no kin of his own, had taken to
his heart generously, as he had taken John
Eaton and John Overton, Ralph, the young
painter, and, twenty years ago, Aaron Burr&mdash;too
bad that charming man had come to be in bad
repute!&mdash;even Sam Houston! Rachel glowed
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
with happiness as the clan came noisily into the
room. This was as things should be. She took
the chair Ralph pulled out for her, bent her
head in a little prayer of thankfulness, of entreaty
to God that things would go on like this
forever, so long as they lived, in peace here at
their Hermitage.</p>
<p>Then there was the sudden crash of a door
at the rear of the house, a chilly gust blew into
the room and from the pantry there were
squeals of delighted welcome from the waiting
servants. The inner door was flung back and a
travel-stained figure strode into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Christmas gift, everybody!&rdquo; shouted Andrew
Jackson Donelson.</p>
<p>Emily upset her glass as she half rose from
her chair. Carving knife poised, Andrew Jackson
stood drawn back sternly at the head of the
table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; he barked in a military tone, &ldquo;you have
disobeyed me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson Donelson made a little bow,
while the others held their breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle, I admit my disobedience,&rdquo; Jack said
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
humbly. &ldquo;I have come home because now you
will have need of me. I have come home to help
you win the nomination for the office of President
of the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel&rsquo;s little cry of protest was lost in the
gasps of the uninformed around the tables. A
few of the men looked wise and complacent and
Emily noted that John Eaton wore a smug grin.</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson made a slashing motion with
the knife as though he flourished a defiant
sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, I have no intention of seeking
the nomination for the office of President of
the United States!&rdquo; he shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; put in Rachel&rsquo;s small,
shaken voice.</p>
<p>Jack&rsquo;s laughter echoed John Eaton&rsquo;s grin.
&ldquo;You may not be seeking the nomination, sir,
but that nomination is certainly out gunning
for you! All over Kentucky they&rsquo;re talking of
nothing else&mdash;Jackson for President, in 1824&mdash;right
under Henry Clay&rsquo;s nose! They say Clay
is looking for a ground-hog hole to crawl into
dragging his whisky barrel after him. And look
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
at this!&rdquo; He pulled the ragged page of a newspaper
from his pocket, marched to the head of
the table and spread it before his uncle&rsquo;s eyes.
&ldquo;I picked it up in Transylvania, brought it
along&mdash;thought you might not have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John Eaton sprang to study the paper. &ldquo;The
<i>New York Post</i>!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We missed that
one. Let&rsquo;s see what they say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What they say,&rdquo; reported Jack, while the
General still glowered at the paper, &ldquo;is that if
the country was under martial law Andrew
Jackson would be the proper choice for president.
That not being the case, the <i>Post</i> will continue
their support of Secretary of the Navy,
Smith Thompson, for the nomination in
1824.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smith Thompson&mdash;about as much chance for
him as for me!&rdquo; snorted one of the Donelson
clan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crawford will be in the running too,&rdquo; remarked
Ralph Earl. &ldquo;Not a man in the Cabinet
who doesn&rsquo;t believe he would be a better president
than John Quincy Adams, who is certain
he&rsquo;ll be elected president.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody told me&mdash;nobody said a word!&rdquo;
mourned Rachel, looking stunned. &ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d
been elected senator&mdash;but president!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack went to her quickly, put his hands on her
quivering shoulders. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make you a queen,
aunt Rachel. We&rsquo;ll make you the grandest lady
in the land!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll have to live in Washington&mdash;when
I want to stay at home!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to be a queen. Jack, wash yourself and
come and eat your dinner. Mr. Jackson, do
serve the children! Hannah, pass the vegetables.
All of you, eat your dinner&mdash;your Christmas
dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Obediently, Andrew Jackson made wooden
motions of slicing at the turkey. John Eaton took
the knife from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit and eat, sir. Let me finish this business.
He&rsquo;s bound to be nominated, you know,&rdquo; he addressed
the whole group. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a ground swell,
stirring all over the country. Why, just yesterday
the <i>Nashville Clarion</i> stated that the General
was unquestionably the choice of the people,
in justice to themselves! Here, Hannah,
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
here&rsquo;s a fine drumstick for some hungry boy.
Wait, you haven&rsquo;t any gravy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Andrew Jackson looked down the long table
at his wife with a look of humble pleading in
his eyes that she had never seen there
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to tell you tomorrow, my love,&rdquo;
he said meekly. &ldquo;I had warned them all. But
that young scoundrel ruined everything.&rdquo; He
glared at Jack Donelson who patted his aunt&rsquo;s
cheek unperturbed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to need me, aunt Rachel,&rdquo; he
said gleefully. &ldquo;I deserve the rough edge of his
tongue now, he thinks, maybe even his riding
crop on my breeches. But he knows he&rsquo;s going
to be needing all the help he can get, and you
too! You&rsquo;ll need a strong, smart boy around here
when all the furor starts, and I&rsquo;m that boy. Just
one more statement, sir.&rdquo; Jack looked at his
uncle, his chin high and firm. &ldquo;I have a further
announcement to make. I came home because I
saw your situation and your need for assistance.
Also I came home to marry Emily Donelson, if
so be she will have me&mdash;with or without the
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
consent of this assembled family, I mean to
marry Emily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; shouted the General, rapping
the table with his glass, &ldquo;I will not countenance!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rachel got to her feet, startling them all a
little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will countenance it,&rdquo; she said, in a
tone few of them had ever heard her use before.
&ldquo;When young people are in love, that&rsquo;s
the important thing. Maybe you think I don&rsquo;t
know what it is to be in love, Mr. Jackson&mdash;but
unless your memory is very short, you do! There
was a time when you trampled all the difficulties
down with fine scorn&mdash;and if Jack hasn&rsquo;t the
courage to do as we did, then he&rsquo;s no nephew
of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear&mdash;&rdquo; began Jackson, uncertainly, &ldquo;I
had no idea you felt this way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I do feel that way. And I say it&rsquo;s fine
and beautiful for these children who love each
other to marry&mdash;and I say that nobody is going
to oppose it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson rose, smiling ruefully, and laid a hand
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
on Emily&rsquo;s cheek. &ldquo;I seem to be outvoted,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, sir.&rdquo; Jack&rsquo;s grin did not quiver. &ldquo;You
are outvoted. I vote against you&mdash;and aunt
Rachel&mdash;and Emily too, I hope? My dear, are
you standing with me against all these frowning
elders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She sprang up and ran to stand beside him.
&ldquo;Oh&mdash;I am, I am!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter is now settled.&rdquo; Jack kissed her
gravely while all the children screamed their
delight and some of the women began to cry,
then, still jauntily, Jack picked up the glass of
wine before his aunt&rsquo;s plate. &ldquo;A toast to the
bride! And to the next President of the United
States, Andrew Jackson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Chairs fell backward as the company got to
their feet. The servants all shrilled approving
cries. The hubbub and chatter drowned out
Rachel&rsquo;s admonishing voice, begging everybody
to be quiet and eat before everything got cold.
Somehow the dinner was finished. The General
sat in silence through the rest of the meal, and
aunt Rachel was still too, Emily observed, her
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
fingers shaking as she handled her fork and
spoon. Emily went quickly and kissed her on
the cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have me beside you always, aunt
Rachel,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Always!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need you, Emily,&rdquo; Rachel whispered
hoarsely. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need everybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes looked far and strained as though
she saw before her those next five stormy years.
The year that would see Andrew Jackson defeated
for the office of president when the election
was carried into the Senate of the United
States by the failure of any of the seven candidates
to win a majority in the electoral college,
defeated by the trades and connivings of Henry
Clay and by the one vote in the New York delegation
of a tremulous, undecided man named
Van Rensselaer.</p>
<p>And after that the terrible years when the
power and strength of Andrew Jackson would
mount in an invincible tide, when her own
name would be pilloried and long-buried agonies
she had tried to forget dragged from their
graves and published abroad to discredit her
<span class="pb" id="Page_89">89</span>
and her man on horseback. The years that
would be too much for the faithful, failing heart
of Rachel Jackson.</p>
<p>She would never be a queen in that palace
in Washington. But she had no wish to be a
queen. As the day darkened into dusk and the
candles were lighted, she stood alone at her
window looking out upon her quiet garden,
sleeping its winter sleep that promised the
wakening of beauty in the springtime.</p>
<p>It would be a pleasant place to sleep, she was
thinking. But at least, at long last, she had had
her Christmas at the Hermitage.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
